Description: Finds a good fit to the data using k-means clustering algorithm. Then merges the adjacent dense spherical clusters to find non-spherical cluster shapes. Number of clusters is determined using a piece-wise-linear-regression-based change point detection algorithm on the mahalanobis distance between the clusters.
